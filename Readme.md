This is a small Shiny application that counts word frequencies. The code is basic and therefore some HTML terms and other code inevitably cloud the counts. Paste in any link into the box and the plots will update to reflect the word counts. Links that lead directly to .txt files work best. Try something from [https://www.gutenberg.org/](https://www.gutenberg.org/) or [http://textfiles.com/directory.html](http://textfiles.com/directory.html). The "Remove filler words?" option removes the top 100 most used words in the English language. These are mostly short words that are used for general sentence structure. The list can be found [here](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/words/the-oec-facts-about-the-language).
